# What-I-learned
What I learned about Git And Github
I learned how to create projects and repositories as well as clone them to my desktop.
I also learned how to port projects to and from Replit and commit those changes to my project.
Git itself is the project repository where I can edit and change it whilst the GitHub is a place to store all of my projects to share my changes.
